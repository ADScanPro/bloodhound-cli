# BloodHound MCP Usage

Follow this rule whenever a task involves BloodHound query syntax, API behaviour, or feature constraints.

## Required Actions

- Use the BloodHound MCP knowledge base as the first source of truth for queries, relationship types, API endpoints, and feature support.
- When in doubt about Cypher syntax, supported constructs, or REST contract details, open the MCP resource and confirm instead of relying on memory.
- Document relevant findings (query shapes, limitations) in the code comments or README if they influence implementation decisions.

## Additional Notes

- Prefer examples from MCP docs to craft or validate `MATCH`, `WHERE`, and relationship traversal clauses.
- If information is missing from MCP, call it out explicitly in the response and request clarification or gather manual evidence (e.g. via testing).
