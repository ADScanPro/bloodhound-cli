- Store secrets and environment-specific values in `.env` files kept out of version control (see `.env.example` for keys to maintain).
- Model configuration with `pydantic-settings` so CLI options, environment variables, and `.env` files are validated automatically.

- Document any new environment variable in `README.md` and update `.env.example` accordingly.
