- Wrap external I/O (network, filesystem, subprocess) in explicit try/except blocks; bubble up unexpected exceptions after logging.
- Configure and reuse `structlog` for logging (see `src/bloodhound_cli/core/logging_utils.py` once added) and log at `error` level with contextual identifiers (command, entity ids, API endpoint).
- When recovering from an exception, include the original exception message with `exc_info=True` (or `structlog`'s `exception()` helper) to preserve the traceback.
- Add structured context (dict-style fields) so logs can be filtered; avoid bare `print` for error paths, and only fall back to Rich console output for user-facing summaries.
