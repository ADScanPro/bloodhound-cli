- Before changing code, inspect existing modules in `src/bloodhound_cli` to understand current patterns and reuse shared helpers where possible.
- Default to writing composable functions and classes with clear responsibilities; avoid monolithic scripts.
- Automate repetitive CLI tasks by extending the tooling under `scripts/` rather than adding ad-hoc shell commands in docs or comments.
